# Mithka

A cross-platform (iOS + Android) Telegram client built with **Flutter** on top of
**[TDLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib)** via FFI, with a UI **inspired by the
look and feel of QQ / WeChat-style messengers**.

## The name

A play on small units of mass, by way of the penguin:

- The penguin mascot is a **pengram** — 🐧 + *gram*, read as **penta-gram** ≈ **5 g**.
- One **mithqāl** (مثقال), a traditional Islamic unit of mass, is **≈ 4.6875 g**.

So **Mithka** (from *mithqāl*) is the featherweight just under the (Tele)gram
penguin on the scale.

## What it is

Mithka connects to **real Telegram** (your account, your chats) through TDLib and
presents it with a QQ-inspired interface: chat list, conversations with live
state, reactions and stickers (including animated `.tgs`/`.webm`), voice notes,
polls and checklists, location sharing, contacts, profiles, moments-style
stories, settings, and a 1:1 call UI.

## Architecture

- **Flutter** UI (`lib/`), state via `provider` + `ChangeNotifier`.
- **TDLib** linked through Dart FFI (`lib/tdlib/`); the native `libtdjson`
  binary is built per platform (see below) and is **not** committed.
- All theming is adaptive (light / dark); UI components are Cupertino/custom —
  no Material dialogs, snackbars, or switches.

## Building

You need your own **Telegram API credentials** (`api_id` / `api_hash`) from
<https://my.telegram.org>. They are read from a git-ignored
`lib/config/secrets.dart`:

```dart
class Secrets {
  static const int apiId = 123456;
  static const String apiHash = 'your_api_hash';
  static bool get isConfigured => apiId != 0 && apiHash.isNotEmpty;
}
```

The TDLib native library is built with the helper scripts (output is git-ignored):

```bash
# Android (per ABI) — produces android/app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/libtdjson.so
scripts/build-tdjson-android.sh arm64-v8a

# iOS — produces the libtdjson framework consumed by the Runner
scripts/build-tdjson-ios.sh
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run            # on a connected device / simulator
```

### Release signing (Android)

Release builds are signed with the project's upload key when
`android/key.properties` (and the referenced keystore) are present; otherwise a
debug signature is used. Neither the keystore nor `key.properties` is committed.

## CI

GitHub Actions runs format + analyze + tests on the `release` branch (see
`.github/workflows/`). `secrets.dart` is generated on the runner from the
`TELEGRAM_API_ID` / `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` repository secrets.
